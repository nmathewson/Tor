  o Code simplification and refactoring (relay address):
    - Most of IPv4 representation was using "uint32_t". It has now been moved to
      use the internal "tor_addr_t" interface instead. This is so we can
      properly integrate IPv6 along IPv4 with common interfaces. Closes ticket
      40043.
