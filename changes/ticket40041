  o Minor features (logging):
    - Provide more complete descriptions of our connections when logging
      about them. Closes ticket 40041.

  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Refactor our code that logs a descriptions of connections, channels,
      and the peers on them, to use a single call path. This change
      enables us to refactor the data types that they use, and eliminate
      many confusing users of those types. Closes ticket 40041.
