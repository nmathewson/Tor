  o Minor bugfixes (linux seccomp sandbox):
    - Correct how we use libseccomp. Particularly, stop assuming that
      rules are applied in a particular order or that more rules are
      processed after the first match. Neither is the case! In libseccomp
      <2.4.0 this lead to some rules having no effect. Libseccomp 2.4.0
      changed how rules are generated leading to a different ordering
      which in turn lead to a fatal crash during startup. Fixes bug
      29819; bugfix on 0.2.5.1-alpha. Patch by Peter Gerber.
