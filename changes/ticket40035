  o Major bugfixes (NSS):
    - When running with NSS enabled, make sure that NSS knows to expect
      nonblocking sockets. Previously, we set our TCP sockets as blocking,
      but did not tell NSS about the fact, which in turn could lead to
      unexpected blocking behavior. Fixes bug 40035; bugfix on 0.3.5.1-alpha.
