  o Minor features (Linux seccomp2 sandbox, compilation):
    - Allow Tor to build on platforms where it doesn't know how to
      report which syscall had caused the linux seccomp2 sandbox
      to fail. This change should make the sandbox code more portable
      to less common Linux architectures.
      Closes ticket 34382.
