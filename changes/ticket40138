  o Minor features (build):
    - When running the configure script, try to detect version mismatches
      between the openssl headers and libraries, and suggest that the
      user should try "--with-openssl-dir". Closes 40138.
    - If the configure script has given any warnings, remind the user about
      them at the end of the script. Related to 40138.
