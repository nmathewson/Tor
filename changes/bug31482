  o Minor bugfixes (monotonic time, osx, ios):
    - Avoid certain conversion errors when converting between
      coarse-timestamps (easy to calculate with) and milliseconds
      on some Apple platforms. Notably, this fix may improve the accuracy
      of bandwidth rate-limiting on iOS. Fixes bug 31482; bugfix on
      0.3.4.1-alpha.
