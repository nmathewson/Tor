  o Major bugfixes (crash, android):
    - Tolerate systems (including some Android installations) where madvise
      and MADV_DONTDUMP are available at build-time, but not at run time.
      Previously, these systems would notice a failed syscall and abort.
      Fixes bug 31570; bugfix on 0.4.1.1-alpha.
