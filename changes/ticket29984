  o Minor bugfixes (controller protocol):
    - Teach the controller parser to correctly distinguish an object
      preceded by an argument list from one without. Previously, it
      couldn't distinguish an argument list from the first line of a
      multiline object. Fixes bug 29984; bugfix on 0.2.3.8-alpha.
