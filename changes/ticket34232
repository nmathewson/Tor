  o Minor bugfixes (string handling):
    - In summarize_protover_flags(), treat empty strings the same as NULL.
      This prevents protocols_known from being set. Previously, we treated
      empty strings as normal strings, which led to protocols_known being
      set. Fixes bug 34232; bugfix on 0.3.3.2-alpha. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
