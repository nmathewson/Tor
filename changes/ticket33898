  o Minor features (relay address tracking):
    - We store relay addresses for OR connections in a more logical way.
      Previously we would sometimes overwrite the actual address of a
      connection with a "canonical address", and then store the "real
      address" elsewhere to remember it.  We now track the "canonical address"
      elsewhere for the cases where we need it, and leave the connection's
      address alone.  Closes ticket 33898.
