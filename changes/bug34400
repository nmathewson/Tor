  o Minor bugfixes (v2 onion services):
    - For HSFETCH commands on v2 onion services addresses, check the length of
      bytes decoded, not the base32 length. This takes the behavior introduced
      in commit a517daa56f5848d25ba79617a1a7b82ed2b0a7c0 into consideration.
      Fixes bug 34400; bugfix on 0.4.1.1-alpha. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
