  o Minor bugfixes (self-testing):
    - When receiving an incoming circuit, only accept it as evidence that we
      are reachable if the declared address of its channel is the same
      address we think that we have.  Otherwise, it could be evidence that
      we're reachable on some other address. Fixes bug 20165; bugfix on
      0.1.0.1-rc.
