  o Minor bugfixes (circuit padding negotiation):
    - Bump circuit padding protover to explicitly signify that the hs setup
      machine support is finalized in 0.4.1.x-stable. This also means that
      0.4.1.x-alpha clients will not negotiate padding with 0.4.1.x-stable
      relays, and 0.4.1.x-stable clients will not negotiate padding with
      0.4.1.x-alpha relays (or 0.4.0.x relays). Fixes bug 31356;
      bugfix on 0.4.1.1-alpha.
  o Minor features (circuit padding logging):
    - Demote noisy client-side warn log to a protocol warning. Add additional
      log messages and circuit id fields to help with fixing bug 30992 and any
      other future issues.
