  o Minor features (directory authority):
    - Authorities now recommend protocol versions that are supported
      by Tor 0.3.5 and later. (Earlier versions of Tor have been
      deprecated since January of this year.)  This recommendation
      will cause older clients and relays to give a warning on startup,
      or when they download a consensus directory.
      Closes ticket 32696.
