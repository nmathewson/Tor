  o Minor features (bootstrap reporting):
    - Report more detailed reasons for bootstrap failure when the failure
      happens due to a TLS error. Previously we would just call these errors
      "MISC" when they happened during read, and "DONE" when they
      happened during any other TLS operation. Closes ticket 32622.
