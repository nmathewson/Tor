  o Major bugfix (TLS, buffer):
    - When attempting to read N bytes on a TLS connection, really try to read
      those N bytes. Before that, Tor would stop reading after the first TLS
      record which can be smaller than N bytes even though more data was waiting
      on the TLS connection socket. The remaining data would have been read at
      the next mainloop event. Fixes bug 40006; bugfix on 0.1.0.5-rc.
