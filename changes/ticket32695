  o Removed features:
    - We no longer support consensus methods before method 28; these
      methods were only used by authorities running versions of Tor that
      are now at end-of-life. In effect, this means that clients and
      relays, and authorities now assume that authorities will be
      running version 0.3.5.x or later. Closes ticket 32695.
