  o Minor features (state):
    - When loading the state file, remove entries from the statefile that
      have been obsolete for a long time.  Ordinarily Tor preserves
      unrecognized entries in order to keep forward-compatibility, but
      these statefile entries have not actually been used in any release
      since before the 0.3.5.x. Closes ticket 40137.
