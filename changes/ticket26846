  o Minor features (authenticated SENDME):
    - Ensure that there is enough randomness on every circuit
      to prevent an attacker from successfully predicting what SENDME cells
      they will need to send: at a random interval, if we have not send
      randomness already, leave some extra space at the end of a cell that
      we can fill with random bytes.  Closes ticket 26846.
