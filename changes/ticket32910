  o Major feature (tracing):
    - Add a tracing library with USDT and LTTng-UST support. Few tracepoints
      were added in the circuit subsystem. More will come incrementally. This
      feature is compiled out by default. It needs to be enabled at configure
      time. See documentation in doc/HACKING/Tracing.md. Closes ticket 32910.
